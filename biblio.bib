  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, but the bar for clinical applications is high. Attempts to assess the clinical knowledge of models typically rely on automated evaluations based on limited benchmarks. Here, to address these limitations, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing medical question answering datasets spanning professional medicine, research and consumer queries and a new dataset of medical questions searched online, HealthSearchQA. We propose a human evaluation framework for model answers along multiple axes including factuality, comprehension, reasoning, possible harm and bias. In addition, we evaluate Pathways Language Model1 (PaLM, a 540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM2 on MultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA3, MedMCQA4, PubMedQA5 and Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) clinical topics6), including 67.6{\%} accuracy on MedQA (US Medical Licensing Exam-style questions), surpassing the prior state of the art by more than 17{\%}. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps. To resolve this, we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, knowledge recall and reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal limitations of today's models, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method development in creating safe, helpful LLMs for clinical applications.},

It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

Information theoretic metrics were used to compare the univariate distributions between real and synthetic data. Percentage {CI} overlap was used to assess the similarity in the size of the bivariate relationships, and similarly for the multivariate Cox models derived from the two datasets. {RESULTS}: Analysis results were similar between the real and synthetic datasets. The univariate distributions were within 1\% of difference on an information theoretic metric. All of the bivariate relationships had {CI} overlap on the tau statistic above 50\%. The main conclusion from the published study, that lack of bowel obstruction has a strong impact on survival, was replicated directionally and the {HR} {CI} overlap between the real and synthetic data was 61\% for overall survival (real data: {HR} 1.56, 95\% {CI} 1.11 to 2.2; synthetic data: {HR} 2.03, 95\% {CI} 1.44 to 2.87) and 86\% for disease-free survival (real data: {HR} 1.51, 95\% {CI} 1.18 to 1.95; synthetic data: {HR} 1.63, 95\% {CI} 1.26 to 2.1). {CONCLUSIONS}: The high concordance between the analytical results and conclusions from synthetic and real data suggests that synthetic data can be used as a reasonable proxy for real clinical trial datasets. {TRIAL} {REGISTRATION} {NUMBER}: {NCT}00079274.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning methods offer great promise for fast and accurate detection and prognostication of coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) from standard-of-care chest radiographs ({CXR}) and chest computed tomography ({CT}) images. Many articles have been published in 2020 describing new machine learning-based models for both of these tasks, but it is unclear which are of potential clinical utility. In this systematic review, we consider all published papers and preprints, for the period from 1 January 2020 to 3 October 2020, which describe new machine learning models for the diagnosis or prognosis of {COVID}-19 from {CXR} or {CT} images. All manuscripts uploaded to {bioRxiv}, {medRxiv} and {arXiv} along with all entries in {EMBASE} and {MEDLINE} in this timeframe are considered. Our search identified 2,212 studies, of which 415 were included after initial screening and, after quality screening, 62 studies were included in this systematic review. Our review finds that none of the models identified are of potential clinical use due to methodological flaws and/or underlying biases. This is a major weakness, given the urgency with which validated {COVID}-19 models are needed. To address this, we give many recommendations which, if followed, will solve these issues and lead to higher-quality model development and well-documented manuscripts.},

  abstract     = {{BACKGROUND}: We propose a decision-referral approach for integrating artificial intelligence ({AI}) into the breast-cancer screening pathway, whereby the algorithm makes predictions on the basis of its quantification of uncertainty. Algorithmic assessments with high certainty are done automatically, whereas assessments with lower certainty are referred to the radiologist. This two-part {AI} system can triage normal mammography exams and provide post-hoc cancer detection to maintain a high degree of sensitivity. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of this {AI} system on sensitivity and specificity when used either as a standalone system or within a decision-referral approach, compared with the original radiologist decision. {METHODS}: We used a retrospective dataset consisting of 1 193 197 full-field, digital mammography studies carried out between Jan 1, 2007, and Dec 31, 2020, from eight screening sites participating in the German national breast-cancer screening programme. We derived an internal-test dataset from six screening sites (1670 screen-detected cancers and 19 997 normal mammography exams), and an external-test dataset of breast cancer screening exams (2793 screen-detected cancers and 80 058 normal exams) from two additional screening sites to evaluate the performance of an {AI} algorithm on sensitivity and specificity when used either as a standalone system or within a decision-referral approach, compared with the original individual radiologist decision at the point-of-screen reading ahead of the consensus conference. Different configurations of the {AI} algorithm were evaluated. To account for the enrichment of the datasets caused by oversampling cancer cases, weights were applied to reflect the actual distribution of study types in the screening programme. Triaging performance was evaluated as the rate of exams correctly identified as normal. Sensitivity across clinically relevant subgroups, screening sites, and device manufacturers was compared between standalone {AI}, the radiologist, and decision referral. We present receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) curves and area under the {ROC} ({AUROC}) to evaluate {AI}-system performance over its entire operating range. Comparison with radiologists and subgroup analysis was based on sensitivity and specificity at clinically relevant configurations. {FINDINGS}: The exemplary configuration of the {AI} system in standalone mode achieved a sensitivity of 84·2\% (95\% {CI} 82·4-85·8) and a specificity of 89·5\% (89·0-89·9) on internal-test data, and a sensitivity of 84·6\% (83·3-85·9) and a specificity of 91·3\% (91·1-91·5) on external-test data, but was less accurate than the average unaided radiologist. By contrast, the simulated decision-referral approach significantly improved upon radiologist sensitivity by 2·6 percentage points and specificity by 1·0 percentage points, corresponding to a triaging performance at 63·0\% on the external dataset; the {AUROC} was 0·982 (95\% {CI} 0·978-0·986) on the subset of studies assessed by {AI}, surpassing radiologist performance. The decision-referral approach also yielded significant increases in sensitivity for a number of clinically relevant subgroups, including subgroups of small lesion sizes and invasive carcinomas. Sensitivity of the decision-referral approach was consistent across the eight included screening sites and three device manufacturers. {INTERPRETATION}: The decision-referral approach leverages the strengths of both the radiologist and {AI}, demonstrating improvements in sensitivity and specificity surpassing that of the individual radiologist and of the standalone {AI} system. This approach has the potential to improve the screening accuracy of radiologists, is adaptive to the requirements of screening, and could allow for the reduction of workload ahead of the consensus conference, without discarding the generalised knowledge of radiologists. {FUNDING}: Vara.},

  abstract     = {For the past decade, it has become commonplace to provide rapid answers and early patient access to innovative treatments in the absence of randomized clinical trials ({RCT}), with benefits estimated from single-arm trials. This trend is important in oncology, notably when assessing new targeted therapies. Some of those uncontrolled trials further include an external/synthetic control group as an innovative way to provide an indirect comparison with a pertinent control group. We aimed to provide some guidelines as a comprehensive tool for (1) the critical appraisal of those comparisons or (2) for performing a single-arm trial. We used the example of ciltacabtagene autoleucel for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after 3 or more treatment lines as an illustrative example. We propose a 3-step guidance. The first step includes the definition of an estimand, which encompasses the treatment effect and the targeted population (whole population or restricted to single-arm trial or external controls), reflecting a clinical question. The second step relies on the adequate selection of external controls from previous {RCTs} or real-world data from patient cohorts, registries, or electronic patient files. The third step consists of choosing the statistical approach targeting the treatment effect defined above and depends on the available data (individual-level data or aggregated external data). The validity of the treatment effect derived from indirect comparisons heavily depends on careful methodological considerations included in the proposed 3-step procedure. Because the level of evidence of a well-conducted {RCT} cannot be guaranteed, the evaluation is more important than in standard settings.},

  abstract     = {While nearly all computational methods operate on pseudonymized personal data, re-identification remains a risk. With personal health data, this re-identification risk may be considered a double-crossing of patients' trust. Herein, we present a new method to generate synthetic data of individual granularity while holding on to patients' privacy. Developed for sensitive biomedical data, the method is patient-centric as it uses a local model to generate random new synthetic data, called an "avatar data", for each initial sensitive individual. This method, compared with 2 other synthetic data generation techniques (Synthpop, {CT}-{GAN}), is applied to real health data with a clinical trial and a cancer observational study to evaluate the protection it provides while retaining the original statistical information. Compared to Synthpop and {CT}-{GAN}, the Avatar method shows a similar level of signal maintenance while allowing to compute additional privacy metrics. In the light of distance-based privacy metrics, each individual produces an avatar simulation that is on average indistinguishable from 12 other generated avatar simulations for the clinical trial and 24 for the observational study. Data transformation using the Avatar method both preserves, the evaluation of the treatment's effectiveness with similar hazard ratios for the clinical trial (original {HR} = 0.49 [95\% {CI}, 0.39-0.63] vs. avatar {HR} = 0.40 [95\% {CI}, 0.31-0.52]) and the classification properties for the observational study (original {AUC} = 99.46 (s.e. 0.25) vs. avatar {AUC} = 99.84 (s.e. 0.12)). Once validated by privacy metrics, anonymous synthetic data enable the creation of value from sensitive pseudonymized data analyses by tackling the risk of a privacy breach.},

  abstract     = {Data are central to research, public health, and in developing health information technology ({IT}) systems. Nevertheless, access to most data in health care is tightly controlled, which may limit innovation, development, and efficient implementation of new research, products, services, or systems. Using synthetic data is one of the many innovative ways that can allow organizations to share datasets with broader users. However, only a limited set of literature is available that explores its potentials and applications in health care. In this review paper, we examined existing literature to bridge the gap and highlight the utility of synthetic data in health care. We searched {PubMed}, Scopus, and Google Scholar to identify peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, reports, and thesis/dissertations articles related to the generation and use of synthetic datasets in health care. The review identified seven use cases of synthetic data in health care: a) simulation and prediction research, b) hypothesis, methods, and algorithm testing, c) epidemiology/public health research, d) health {IT} development, e) education and training, f) public release of datasets, and g) linking data. The review also identified readily and publicly accessible health care datasets, databases, and sandboxes containing synthetic data with varying degrees of utility for research, education, and software development. The review provided evidence that synthetic data are helpful in different aspects of health care and research. While the original real data remains the preferred choice, synthetic data hold possibilities in bridging data access gaps in research and evidence-based policymaking.},

However, particularly in fields that heavily rely on clinical information, such as medicine or pharmacy, not only the collection of patient data is expensive and time consuming, but, due to data protection laws and regulations, the ways of how to use them are strictly limited, deeming reuse or sharing very difficult, if not impossible. One promising solution to overcome these problems are artificially created data points with the same statistical properties as the investigated patient population. In this paper, we propose the {GANerAid} architecture, utilising a Generative Adversarial Network ({GAN}) approach to create such synthetic patients from random noise. Unlike other methods, {GANerAid} is based on long short-term memory ({LSTM}) layers and is thus able to preserve underlying data properties, such as correlations and variable distributions, leading to more satisfying results, even in small-sized samples, with acceptable training speed. {GANerAid} is published as an open source library and released as a ready-to-use package for Python 3.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer’s disease is a kind of neurological disorder that directly impacts the memory of a patient. Structural magnetic resonance imaging ({sMRI}) is an effective representation for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. Deep learning strategies, such as convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}), require an enormous amount of data to generalize the target disease. Given the restrictions on collecting data, augmentation methods are important tools for increasing the number of samples available for training a {CNN}. Recently, generative adversarial networks ({GANs}) have been employed to generate synthetic medical data such as {sMRI}. In this paper, we propose a conditional progressive {GAN} ({cProGAN}) for data augmentation. The proposed {cProGAN} utilizes additive noise, which is regulated by the feedback from the discriminator that is trained by labeled data. The synthetic samples generated by using {cProGAN} go through a sample selection process regulated by the distributions of the original data mapped into the linear discriminator analysis ({LDA}) space. Three-class labeled data are mapped into {LDA} space where each class is modeled within an elliptic confidence subspace. Generated synthetic data that falls into these class subspaces are selected as the synthetic data to be used for training the {CNN}. This strategy helps select the most relevant samples with the desired class. Evidently, based on the experimental results, the suggested {cProGAN} creates synthetic data with higher quality than other state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, class-specific {LDA} subspace post-processing helps the selection of class-separated augmented data for improved classification performance.},

I devote particular attention to the proofs and arguments of Minsky and Papert, which were interpreted as showing that further progress in neural nets was not possible, and that this approach to {AI} had to be abandoned. I maintain that this official interpretation of the debate was a result of the emergence, institutionalization and (importantly) legitimation of the symbolic {AI} approach (with its resource allocation system and authority structure). At the 'research-area' level, there was considerable interpretative flexibility. This interpretative flexibility was further demonstrated by the revival of neural nets in the late 1980s, and subsequent rewriting of the official history of the debate.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory ({LSTM}). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, {LSTM} can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. {LSTM} is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, {LSTM} leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. {LSTM} also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

Unfortunately, a complete set of {MR} contrasts is often difficult to obtain in a real clinical environment. Recently, there have been claims that generative models such as generative adversarial networks ({GANs}) can synthesize {MR} contrasts that are not acquired. However, the poor scalability of existing {GAN}-based image synthesis poses a fundamental challenge to understanding the nature of {MR} contrasts: which contrasts matter, and which cannot be synthesized by generative models? Here, we show that these questions can be addressed systematically by learning the joint manifold of multiple {MR} contrasts using collaborative generative adversarial networks. Our experimental results show that the exogenous contrast provided by contrast agents is not replaceable, but endogenous contrasts such as T1 and T2 can be synthesized from other contrasts. These findings provide important guidance for the acquisition-protocol design of {MR} in clinical environments.},

We developed Mirai, a mammography-based deep learning model designed to predict risk at multiple timepoints, leverage potentially missing risk factor information, and produce predictions that are consistent across mammography machines. Mirai was trained on a large dataset from Massachusetts General Hospital ({MGH}) in the United States and tested on held-out test sets from {MGH}, Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden, and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital ({CGMH}) in Taiwan, obtaining C-indices of 0.76 (95\% confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.80), 0.81 (0.79 to 0.82), and 0.79 (0.79 to 0.83), respectively. Mirai obtained significantly higher 5-year {ROC} {AUCs} than the Tyrer-Cuzick model ( P {\textless} 0.001) and prior deep learning models Hybrid {DL} ( P {\textless} 0.001) and Image-Only {DL} ( P {\textless} 0.001), trained on the same dataset. Mirai more accurately identified high-risk patients than prior methods across all datasets. On the {MGH} test set, 41.5\% (34.4 to 48.5) of patients who would develop cancer within 5 years were identified as high risk, compared with 36.1\% (29.1 to 42.9) by Hybrid {DL} ( P = 0.02) and 22.9\% (15.9 to 29.6) by the Tyrer-Cuzick model ( P {\textless} 0.001).},

  abstract   = {The rapid progress in machine learning ({ML}) has brought forth many large language models ({LLMs}) that excel in various tasks and areas. These {LLMs} come with different abilities and costs in terms of computation or pricing. Since the demand for each query can vary, e.g., because of the queried domain or its complexity, defaulting to one {LLM} in an application is not usually the best choice, whether it is the biggest, priciest, or even the one with the best average test performance. Consequently, picking the right {LLM} that is both accurate and cost-effective for an application remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce {MetaLLM}, a framework that dynamically and intelligently routes each query to the optimal {LLM} (among several available {LLMs}) for classification tasks, achieving significantly improved accuracy and cost-effectiveness. By framing the selection problem as a multi-armed bandit, {MetaLLM} balances prediction accuracy and cost efficiency under uncertainty. Our experiments, conducted on popular {LLM} platforms such as {OpenAI}'s {GPT} models, Amazon's Titan, Anthropic's Claude, and Meta's {LLaMa}, showcase {MetaLLM}'s efficacy in real-world scenarios, laying the groundwork for future extensions beyond classification tasks.},

  abstract     = {We live in an age where the sharing of scientific findings and ideas is no longer confined to people with access to academic libraries or scientific journals. Social media have permitted for knowledge and ideas to be shared with an unprecedented speed and magnitude. This has made it possible for research findings to have a greater impact and to be rapidly implemented in society. However, the spread of unfiltered, unreferenced, and non-peer-reviewed articles through social media comes with dangers as well. In this perspective article, we aim to address both the possibilities and pitfalls of social media for translational medicine. We describe how social media can be used for patient engagement, publicity, transparency, sharing of knowledge, and implementing findings in society. Moreover, we warn about the potential pitfalls of social media, which can cause research to be misinterpreted and false beliefs to be spread. We conclude by giving advice on how social media can be harnessed to combat the pitfalls and provide a new avenue for community engagement in translational medicine.},

"A modern classic . . . a straight-talking survival guide to the mean streets of a dying democracy and a global pandemic."--WiredMisinformation, disinformation, and fake news abound and it's increasingly difficult to know what's true. Our media environment has become hyperpartisan. Science is conducted by press release. Startup culture elevates bullshit to high art. We are fairly well equipped to spot the sort of old-school bullshit that is based in fancy rhetoric and weasel words, but most of us don't feel qualified to challenge the avalanche of new-school bullshit presented in the language of math, science, or statistics. In Calling Bullshit,  Professors Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West give us a set of powerful tools to cut through the most intimidating data. You don't need a lot of technical expertise to call out problems with data. Are the numbers or results too good or too dramatic to be true? Is the claim comparing like with like? Is it confirming your personal bias? Drawing on a deep well of expertise in statistics and computational biology, Bergstrom and West exuberantly unpack examples of selection bias and muddled data visualization, distinguish between correlation and causation, and examine the susceptibility of science to modern bullshit. We have always needed people who call bullshit when necessary, whether within a circle of friends, a community of scholars, or the citizenry of a nation. Now that bullshit has evolved, we need to relearn the art of skepticism.},
